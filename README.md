# STARTUP AGENCY Design & Coding

Students in groups of 4 are responsible for designing a professional agency site(mobile, tablet and desktop) with an original logo & tagline. The groups will also design and animate a video to promote the new startup advertising agency.

The startup agency is owned by each group member, so every member has a say in the look and feel of the projects. Stay consistent in the look of the logo through the website and video.

Make all the required elements cohesive in the brand experience. You will write your own content for each page as well. Come up with headings and body copy that match the tone of your newly created agency's brand.
